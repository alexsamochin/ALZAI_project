# Likely Error Causes

Label uncertainty:

Diagnosis year uncertainty or mislabeling could reduce predictive signal.

Subgroup imbalance:

Some categories (e.g., race = Black) have fewer samples â†’ lower performance.

Feature availability/quality:

Missing lab values or infrequent events can cause higher false negatives in specific subgroups.

# Proposed Improvements

Data Augmentation / Reweighting:

Oversample underrepresented subgroups or apply subgroup-aware class weights in XGBoost.

Feature Engineering:

Introduce temporal rolling aggregates per subgroup to capture trends better.

Label Smoothing / Probabilistic Targets:

If diagnosis year is uncertain, consider modeling the label as a probability instead of binary.

Threshold Tuning per Subgroup:

Instead of one global threshold, adapt threshold per subgroup to balance sensitivity & specificity.
